# Sentiment-Analysis-using-RNN
The sentiment analysis of food reviews has gotten much attention in the recent decade, thanks to the rise of food delivery and cloud kitchen enterprises. The computer study of evaluating people's feelings and views of an entity is known as sentiment analysis. User-generated material through electronic word-of-mouth (WoM) platforms, such as OpenTable and Yelp, is typically deemed more reliable and trustworthy than advertisements from retailers. 

This project aims to classify a prominent restaurant's review using deep learning models. The OpenTable reviews were pulled directly from the website using web scraping techniques. The proposed work focuses on classifying the sentiment polarity of user reviews. 

Deep neural networks, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Networks, and Gated Recurrent Units, were used in the project. The proposed system gains a deeper understanding of these algorithms by comparing the results. In addition, the suggested work's Deep Learning technique successfully provides a framework for identifying review polarity. 

This aids restaurateurs in forming a community and promoting a positive image of their companies through regular updates. It helps them engage with and respond to positive and negative online customer reviews.
